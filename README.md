Web App that displays an interactive map for Orcas 

https://orcas.onrender.com (deployed but 3-5 minute startup time - open in new tab & don't refresh, just wait patiently for the server to start)

Alternatively to run on your local computer:

Requirements:

- install `python 3.10`
- install git

in a new terminal:

`$ cd <location of your choice>`

`$ git clone https://github.com/hmartin11/info300.git`

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

`$ python3 app.py`

copy and paste local host URL into browser

(the $ 's are not part of the commands, it's to indicate they should be run in the terminal)
